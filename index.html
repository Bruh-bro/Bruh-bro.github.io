                        <hr>
                        <p>
                             A snackshop is a student runned store. Every year 10 who picked <b> Enterprise </b> for <strong> <u> IGCSE </u> </strong> would be in charge of taking care of the snackshop as their class job. Giving the customers (teachers & students) the snack they ask for and restock as their daily job. As if it was their part time job. Members of the snackshop also sends out public emails to see their feedback, so they know what to improve on and change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             Students who is in charge of taking care of other students and teachers have to give away their break and lunchtime to be able to give their customers the snack that they need. The snackshop was made for replenishing students and teachers.

                        </blockquote>
                        <h2 style="font-size: 2em"> Are there any other shops besides the Snack shop? </h2>
                        <p>
                             There are other shops that sells different snacks and drinks, but the problem is that they're outside of the school campus. If the student are below year 12 or 13 (and not doing A levels yet), then the only time that the students can visit the other shops is during the morning or after school (safety purposes). 
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            So what's the point of having a student runned snackshop? What's the benefits of running a snack shop?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The point of having a student runned snack shop is to ensure the safety of the students, and teachers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The benefits of those who are running the snack shop can give themselves how the experience of having a job or a part-time job could be like. This can also encourage the students who took GP (Global Perspectives) as their IGCSE to take more responsibility and learn how or what to do to please the customers. The students will also have to learn how to solve complaints which developes transferable skills, and improves the students teamwork.
